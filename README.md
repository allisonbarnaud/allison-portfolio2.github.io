## Personal portfolio version 2

# Background

This is a refresh of my personal portfolio website with a different approach, as I am not satsfied with the direction of my original one.

My new approach to this portfolio website is to leverage open source assets and tools to create a more professional product, as opposed to trying to make everything from scratch in my original portfolio.
