								<span class="image main"><img src="images/profile-photo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia and went to a French Curriculum school until I moved to Australia in 2012 for University to study Electrical Engineering. During my degree I got my first exposure to programming and quickly developed a passion for it.</p>
								<p>Over the next few years I expanded my coding knowledge through various online courses and personal projects.</p>
								<p>In 2017 I graduated University with a double major in Electrical and Control Systems Engineering, and immediately started working as an electrical engineer. After 3 years, I decided to explore a different career path and pursue my passion for Software Development.</p>

								<p>From a Sushi Chef in Perth to working on a Nickel mine in New Caledonia, I have had a wide range of work experience in the last few years:</p>
								<p>I started my engineering career as a Building Services Engineer in 2017, designing electrical infrastructure for landmark buildings around Melbourne. Some of my notable projects include <a href="https://www.collinsarch.com.au/" target="_blank">Collins Arch,</a> and <a href="https://www.fishermansbend.vic.gov.au/media/fishermans-bend-secondary" target="_blank">Port Melbourne Secondary School.</a></p>
								<p>After 2 years of working in Building Services I decided to explore different engineering industries and found my next opportunity as a FIFO Electrical Reliability Consultant on a Nickel mine in New Caledonia. My role involved providing business improvement strategies and engineering design advice. </p>
								<p>During my time off, I continued to learn to code and found myself intrigued by the idea of a career in the Software space. I eventually enrolled into General Assembly's Software Engineering Bootcamp which taught me the fundamentals of full-stack software development. After graduating from General Assembly I was offered my first opportunity at Accenture, where I currently work as a mid-level Software/Devops engineer.</p>
