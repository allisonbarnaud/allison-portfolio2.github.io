								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<p>I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia and went to a French school until I moved to Australia in 2012 for University to study Electrical Engineering. During my degree I got my first exposure to programming and quickly developed a new passion, playing around with programming as a hobby over the next few years.</p>
								<p>When I started working in Electrical Engineering I quickly realised that my career aspirations lied elsewhere, and eventually decided to pursue Software Development as a career.</p>

								<p>From Sushi Chef to working in a Nickel mine on a pacific island, I have had a wide range of work experience the last few years:</p>
								<p>After a brief part-time job as a Sushi Chef, I started my engineering career as a Building Services Engineer, designing electrical infrastructure for landmark buildings around the Melbourne CBD, such as the <a href="https://www.collinsarch.com.au/" target="_blank">Collins Arch,</a> and the <a href="https://www.fishermansbend.vic.gov.au/media/fishermans-bend-secondary" target="_blank">Port Melbourne Secondary School.</a></p>
								<p>After a while I decided to explore more exciting opportunities and found work on a Nickel mine in New Caledonia as an Electrical Reliability Consultant, providing business improvement strategies and engineering design advice. Unfortunately, this opportunity was cut short: as COVID hit, I decided to return to Melbourne to wait out the storm.</p>
								<p>Locked down at home and unemployed, I delved deeper into programming, and decided to enroll into a Software Engineering Bootcamp to build stronger software development fundamentals, which reinforced my passion for coding. After 3 months of intensive learning and 3 more months of job searching I landed my first software development role at Accenture, where I currently work as a software/DevOps engineer.</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Since childhood I have always had a passion for Technology and making things: Between 3D printing and 3D modelling, electronics designs and now programming.</p>
								<p>I am continuously learning and fascinated about Emerging Technologies, and as the world of Software is progressing at an accelerated pace I realised that it is also more accessible than ever, and decided to leap into it and am currently loving it.</p>
								<p>Outside of my career I am also passionate about video-games, food and fitness.</p>
